# Group Assignment Optimization

Utilizing puLP and Gurobi python frameworks to optimize group assignments for an event. 
This utilizes random names and attributes generated by ChatGPT and python random libraries. 

## Goal
The project's goal is to create "optimal" attendee groups for an event. This means maximizing personal preferences while ensuring that no unwanted pairings occur and that no pair meets more than once, allowing attendees to meet as many different people as possible throughout the sessions.


## Mathematical Programming Model Aspects: 
**Decision Variables:**
1. seated_vars:
    - one variable for each person at each table in each session
    - Binary, taking on value of 0 (not seated at this table in this session) or 1 (seated at this table in this session)
2. table_pair_session_vars: 
    - one variable per pair per session
    - Binary, taking on value of 0 (not seated together in this session) or 1 (seated together in this session)

**Constraints:**
1. table_pair_session_vars values are assigned using a combination of linear expressions of seated_vars for the people, tables and sessions related to the particular table_pair_session_vars
2. Each person can only be assigned to one group per 'session' 
3. Each person must be assigned to one group per "session" if they are available for that session
4. Pairs of individuals can only be grouped together up to 3 times throughout the entire event (across all sessions)
5. Ratios of group A members to group B members in each group must abide by the created Frameworks (see more in 'Skeleton of Framework' section of code)
6. (If not added as an objective function) Pairs cannot be in the same group if one has submitted a "dislike" for that pair

**Objective Functions:**
1. Maximize pairs being in the same group where members of the pair both have a preference for one another (mutual preferences)
2. Maximize pairs being in the same group to satisfy preference of GroupA
3. Maximize pairs being in the same group to satisfy preference of GroupB
4. (If not added as a constraint) Minimize pairs being in the same group that satisfy and "dislikes"
