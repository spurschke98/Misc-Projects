# Personal-Projects
Current or Recent projects that I am working on for automation, data analysis, machine learning, and optimization. 

## Group Optimization 
The project's goal is to create "optimal" attendee groups for an event. This means maximizing personal preferences while ensuring that no unwanted pairings occur and that no pair meets more than once, allowing attendees to meet as many different people as possible throughout the sessions. This project uses mathematical programming with puLP and Gurobi frameworks. 

## Meeting Optimization 
**WORK IN PROGRESS** 
This project's goal is to schedule as many meetings as possible (from those requested) considering attendee availability. The secondary objective is to reduce the number of times attendees move from Hotel 1 to Hotel 2 between their meetings, ultimately reducing their travel time between meetings.

## Report Generation Automation 
This project pulls open and click reports for recent email marketing campaigns using the mailchimp API and aggregates them into lead data reports. This script creates a basic web application using streamlit so that a non-technical user can interact with the python program to obtain the reports. This web application is complete in it's simplest form, though I am still working on making it more aesthetically pleasing. 

## Pizza Delivery Subscription 
**Future work** 
- The goal is to predict which topping a customer will want on their pizza so that they do not cancel their pizza subscription, which delivers them one pizza per day. The customer does not have the ability to edit the toppings on their pizza. I want to consider their satisfaction as what to optimize, since this will relate directly to churn.
